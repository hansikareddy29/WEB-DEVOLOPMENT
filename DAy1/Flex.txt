* the axis in which the items are kept that is if flex direction is row then 
the items will be kept row wise naa
so the horizontal axis becomes the MAIN axis
the vertical axis which is perpendicular to the main axis becomes CROSS axis


* if the flex-direction is column then main axis will be vertical and cross axis will be 
horizonatl that is perpendicular to main axis


* now the justify content center property doesnt look for horizonatl or vertical screen
rather it will see how the main axis is aligned 

* if it is that is main axis is horizonatl then it will lay them in horizonatl center and if it is vertical 
it will lay them in vertical center

* it all depends on MAIN AXIS alignment


* and if u give flex start in justify content then it will go according to main start


* what is main start??
if main is vertical 
|-->this is main start
|
|
|
|
|
^-->this is main end
if cross is horizontal
-------------------->|
|                    |
|                     this is cross end
^
this is cross start



* the distance between main start and main end is main size
* the distance between cross start and cross end is cross size
